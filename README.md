## Tech
* Built on the Meteor JS framework, because I'm weird like that 
* ~~HTML~~ Jade + Handlebars + ~~CSS~~ SCSS
* Lettuce Wrap â€“ a mobile first, percentage based grid built using SASS functions
* Electronic music
* Coffee


## Design decisions
* Mobile first
* 1140px, 12 column desktop and tablet grid
* Single column mobile grid
* 16px base type size

## Build goals
* Semantic class names
* Visual styling 99% abstracted to CSS
* Reusable blocks of CSS
* Reasonable use of HTML5 elements
* Other good things
